            <h1>Raise Awareness</h1>
            <p>In the time of this lockdown, there have been various obstacles coming in the way of taking actions to help the environment. Raising Awareness is something you can do from the confort of your homes without risking going outside and coming into contact with people.
                You can do so by enlightening people about the problems and solutions to ensuring clean surroundings on various web portals and social medias. With the boom in technology, you are likely to reach more people through social media rather than physically informing people about the issue.
                Take the first step today!

                <h1>Changes in Lifestyle</h1>
                <p>You can implement some changes in your own lifestyle, and this is one of the most effective and easy ways to support the environment and give a little back to it.
                    We can make sure to limit Air Conditioner usage in our homes, we can segregate our waste ourselves before disposing it off, due to unavailbality of garbage collectors in this time.
                    We can stop the use of plastic etc. for shopping or storage in homes or just usage otherwise and use paper or reusable environment friendly bags instead.
